                promote Norwegian salmon, expecting to use salmon for sushi. In 1994, Japan used Norwegian salmon
                for sashimi and sushi. The Norwegian Seafood Authority brought Norwegian salmon to the Australian
                market decades ago.</div>

        <p class="text-center myDivSpace">The staple food is mainly rice and noodles. Because it is close to the
            sea, the non-staple food is mostly seafood such as fresh fish and shrimp, often accompanied by Japanese
            sake. Washoku is known for its lightness, so try to keep the original flavor of the ingredients when
            cooking.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Eel rice</h4>Unagi rice, also known as eel rice bowl, is one of the
                traditional summer foods in Japan. Unagi rice is a rice bowl made by dipping eel in a sweet and
                salty sauce, and then topping white rice with the side dish eel, also called eel rice bowl. The
                easiest season to taste is summer. This is because the 18 days before the beginning of autumn are
                called "Summer's soil use", which is the hottest period of the year. Since the Edo period, there has
                been "the day of the soil use ugly [around July 25th]. ] If you eat eel, you won’t lose weight in
                summer” because of the saying. Needless to say, there are shops specializing in eel, supermarkets,
                fish shops, etc.

                <h4 class="text-center">soba:</h4>Soba noodles contain 70% starch and 7%-13% protein, and the amino
                acid composition in the protein is relatively balanced, and the content of lysine and threonine is
                relatively rich. Soba noodles contain 2%-3% fat, and the content of oleic acid and linoleic acid,
                which are beneficial to the human body, is also high. These two fatty acids play a role in reducing
                blood lipids in the human body, and are also an important part of an important
                hormone-prostaglandin. The vitamins D1 and B2 in soba noodles are 3-20 times that of wheat flour,
                which are rare in general grains. The biggest nutritional feature of soba noodles is that it is
                rarely available in general food.

                for a few hours, then wrap it in egg liquid, add bread crumbs, and fry it in a pan. The Shanghai
                fried pork chop is a very distinctive traditional snack. It is coated with heavy Chinese flour,
                without bread crumbs, and the seasoning needs to be freshened with spicy soy sauce; Japanese fried
                pork chop is a foreign food in Japanese cuisine..

                quite common. Yakitori (焼きbird/Yakitori) is a Japanese food. Generally speaking, bite-sized pieces
